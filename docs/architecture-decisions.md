# ARD-001: Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-001: Feature Sliced Design Architecture

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-22  
**Context:** Need scalable, maintainable frontend architecture for enterprise React application

### Decision
Adopted Feature Sliced Design (FSD) with 4-layer architecture:
- **app/** - Application layer (providers, routing, global configuration)
- **pages/** - Pages layer (route-level components) 
- **features/** - Features layer (business logic and domain-specific functionality)
- **shared/** - Shared layer (reusable components, utilities, types)

### Rationale
- **Scalability:** Clear separation of concerns enables team scaling
- **Maintainability:** Predictable file organization reduces cognitive load
- **Testability:** Isolated layers enable focused unit testing
- **Reusability:** Shared layer promotes component reuse

### Import Rules
```typescript
// ✅ Allowed: Lower layers can import from higher layers
// app -> pages, features, shared
// pages -> features, shared  
// features -> shared

// ❌ Prohibited: Higher layers cannot import from lower layers
// shared -> features (FORBIDDEN)
// features -> pages (FORBIDDEN)
```

## ADR-002: Material UI + Tailwind CSS Integration

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-22  
**Context:** Need consistent design system with rapid development capabilities

### Decision
Hybrid approach combining Material UI components with Tailwind utilities:
- Material UI for complex components (DataGrid, DatePicker, Autocomplete)
- Tailwind for layout, spacing, custom styling
- Custom theme integration through CSS variables

### Benefits
- **Speed:** Out-of-box Material UI components accelerate development
- **Flexibility:** Tailwind provides granular styling control
- **Consistency:** Shared CSS variables ensure design system coherence
- **Accessibility:** Material UI components include a11y features

## ADR-003: Authentication Strategy

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-22  
**Context:** Need simple, secure authentication for role-based access

### Decision
Cookie-based authentication with mock implementation:
- Email/password login
- HttpOnly cookies for session management
- Role-based route protection (admin/customer)
- Context API for auth state management

### Security Considerations
- Production implementation should use JWT with refresh tokens
- HTTPS required for cookie security
- CSRF protection needed for production
- Rate limiting for login attempts

## ADR-004: State Management Approach

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-22  
**Context:** Avoid complex state management overhead for POC

### Decision
React built-in state management only:
- `useState` for component state
- `useReducer` for complex state logic
- Context API for global state (auth, theme)
- Custom hooks for state abstraction

### Rationale
- **Simplicity:** Reduces bundle size and learning curve
- **React Native:** Leverages platform capabilities
- **Future-proof:** Easy migration to Redux Toolkit if needed
- **Performance:** Selective re-rendering with proper memoization

## ADR-005: TypeScript Configuration

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-22  
**Context:** Ensure maximum type safety and code quality

### Decision
Strictest TypeScript configuration:
- `strict: true`
- `noImplicitAny: true`
- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`
- Zero `any` types allowed
- Comprehensive interface definitions

### Code Quality Rules
- All props interfaces must be explicitly typed
- API responses require type definitions
- Custom hooks must have proper return type annotations
- No implicit returns in complex functions

## ADR-006: Unified Landing Page Architecture

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-10-03  
**Context:** Need to optimize user experience by reducing navigation friction and improving product discovery

### Decision
Adopted Amazon-style unified landing page combining hero section, category navigation, and product catalog:
- Main route ("/") displays hero + categories + full product catalog
- Category cards filter products in place with smooth scrolling
- Product search and filtering without page navigation
- Grid/list view toggle for user preference
- Real-time search with 300ms debouncing

### Benefits
- **Reduced Friction:** Users see products immediately upon landing
- **Better Discovery:** Hero and categories guide users to relevant products
- **Improved UX:** No page loads for filtering, just smooth scrolling
- **Amazon Pattern:** Familiar e-commerce pattern users expect
- **SEO Friendly:** All products on main page for better indexing

### Implementation
```typescript
// Both routes point to same component
Route path="/" -> ProductsPage
Route path="/products" -> ProductsPage (legacy support)
```

### User Flow
1. User lands on "/" or "/products"
2. Sees hero section with CTAs
3. Views category cards
4. Scrolls or clicks "Shop Now" to see products
5. Filters/searches without leaving page
