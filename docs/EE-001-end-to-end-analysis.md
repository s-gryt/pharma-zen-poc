</lov-mermaid>

### High Risk Items
1. **Payment Integration Complexity**
   - Risk: PCI compliance requirements
   - Mitigation: Use Stripe's secure tokenization

2. **Database Performance at Scale**
   - Risk: Slow queries with large datasets
   - Mitigation: Proper indexing and query optimization

3. **Authentication Security**
   - Risk: JWT token vulnerabilities
   - Mitigation: Short-lived tokens with refresh mechanism

### Medium Risk Items
1. **API Response Times**
   - Risk: > 200ms response times
   - Mitigation: Caching and database optimization

2. **Frontend-Backend Integration**
   - Risk: Type mismatches and data inconsistency
   - Mitigation: Shared TypeScript types and validation

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- **API Response Time**: < 200ms for 95% of requests
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability
- **Test Coverage**: > 80% code coverage
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities

### Business KPIs
- **User Experience**: < 3-second page load time
- **Conversion Rate**: Successful order completion
- **Error Rate**: < 1% of user interactions result in errors

## Conclusion

The Walgreens POC frontend is architecturally sound and feature-complete for demonstration purposes. The primary focus should be on backend implementation following the established patterns and technical specifications.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Begin Phase 1 backend development immediately
2. Establish testing infrastructure in parallel
3. Plan production deployment strategy
4. Set up monitoring and error tracking

**Timeline Estimate:** 4-6 weeks for production-ready implementation with the recommended phased approach.
